    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2006, a set of techniques has been developed that enable learning in deep neural nets. These deep learning techniques are based on **stochastic gradient descent** and **backpropagation**, but also introduce new ideas. These techniques have enabled much deeper (and larger) networks to be trained - people now routinely train networks with 5 to 10 hidden layers. And, it turns out that these perform far better on many problems than shallow neural networks, i.e., networks with just a single hidden layer. The reason, of course, is the ability of deep nets to build up a complex hierarchy of concepts. It's a bit like the way conventional programming languages use modular design and ideas about abstraction to enable the creation of complex computer programs. "
