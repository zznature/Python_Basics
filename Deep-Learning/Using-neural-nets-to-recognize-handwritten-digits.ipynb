    "\n",
    "Since 2006, a set of techniques has been developed that enable learning in deep neural nets. These deep learning techniques are based on **stochastic gradient descent** and **backpropagation**, but also introduce new ideas. These techniques have enabled much deeper (and larger) networks to be trained - people now routinely train networks with 5 to 10 hidden layers. And, it turns out that these perform far better on many problems than shallow neural networks, i.e., networks with just a single hidden layer. The reason, of course, is the ability of deep nets to build up a complex hierarchy of concepts. It's a bit like the way conventional programming languages use modular design and ideas about abstraction to enable the creation of complex computer programs. "

This is an easy way of sampling randomly from the training data. Then for each `mini_batch` we apply a single step of gradient descent. This is done by the code `self.update_mini_batch(mini_batch, eta)`, which updates the network weights and biases according to a single iteration of gradient descent, using just the training data in `mini_batch`. \n",

Apart from self.backprop the program is self-explanatory - all the heavy lifting is done in `self.SGD` and `self.update_mini_batch`, which we've already discussed. The `self.backprop` method makes use of a few extra functions to help in computing the gradient, namely `sigmoid_prime`, which computes the derivative of the σ function, and `self.cost_derivative`. "

It does this through a series of many layers, with early layers answering very simple and specific questions about the input image, and later layers building up a hierarchy of ever more complex and abstract concepts. Networks with this kind of many-layer structure - two or more hidden layers - are called deep neural networks."
