    "### The pyplot API\n",
    "`matplotlib.pyplot` is a collection of functions that make Matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.\n",

    "### The object-oriented API\n",
    "At its core, Matplotlib is object-oriented. We recommend directly working with the objects, if you need more control and customization of your plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases you will create a Figure and one or more Axes using `pyplot.subplots` and from then on only work on these objects. However, it's also possible to create Figures explicitly (e.g. when including them in GUI applications).\n",
