    "Colormaps are often split into several categories based on their function (see, e.g., [Moreland]):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential**: change in lightness and often saturation of color incrementally, often using a single hue; should be used for representing information that has ordering.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Diverging**: change in lightness and possibly saturation of two different colors that meet in the middle at an unsaturated color; should be used when the information being plotted has a critical middle value, such as topography or when the data deviates around zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cyclic**: change in lightness of two different colors that meet in the middle and beginning/end at an unsaturated color; should be used for values that wrap around at the endpoints, such as phase angle, wind direction, or time of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Qualitative**: often are miscellaneous colors; should be used to represent information which does not have ordering or relationships."
