# Thinking Python from first principles
 
Learning notes on python and its packages.

It is intended to summarize the basic concepts and syntax in Python in case I would look up.
And most importantly I am trying to demonstrate the basic principle for Python programming.

**Principles**:

How the values are created, represented, changed and saved?

Debugging?

**Main Learing materials:**
