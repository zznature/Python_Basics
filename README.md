# Thinking Python from first principles
 
Learning notes on python and its packages.

It is intended to summarize the basic concepts and syntax in Python in case I would look up.
And most importantly I am trying to demonstrate the basic principle for Python programming.

**Constucting Principles:**
How the values are created, represented, changed and stored?

It consists of building abstractions of data and functions.

**Organising Principles:**

How to organise the program structure?

Interpretation? Debugging?

**Main Learing materials:**

* [python-course.eu](https://python-course.eu/)
