# Thinking Python from first principles

Learning notes on python programming, mainly three paradigms:

1. Abstraction of data and functions,
2. Object-oriented programming,
3. Neural networks.

It is intended to summarize the basic concepts and syntax in Python in case I would look up. Moreover I am trying to dig out the basic principles for Python programming in the process of coding.

**Constucting Principles:**

How the values are created, represented, changed and stored?

It consists of building abstractions of data and functions.

**Organising Principles:**

How to organise the program structure?

Interpretting? Debugging?

**Main Learing materials:**
